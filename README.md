# Test Mod
I'm creating this mod to familiarize myself with scala and the Minecraft Forge modding api. I've had an idea for an interesting mod
for quite some time now, but I have never given myself the time to learn how to actually implement it in Minecraft. My future project is
quite ambitious and there is a lot of learning yet to do until I will be able to start work on it. This project will also serve as a
teaching tool not just to myself, but anyone interested in writing a forge mod in scala. I will try and keep the wiki updated with my
findings so that the findings I make will be beneficial to others.
